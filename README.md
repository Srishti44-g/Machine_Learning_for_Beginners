What Is Machine Learning? ,Why Use Machine Learning?,Types of Machine Learning Systems,Main Challenges of Machine Learning

## What is machine learning?
*Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn
without being explicitly programmed.
—Arthur Samuel, 1959*

**A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T
and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves
with experience E.
—Tom Mitchell, 1997**

## Why Use Machine Learning?
**Traditional Approach**

## Types of Machine Learning System
1. Supervised Learning
2. Unsupervised Learning
3. Reinforcement Learning
4. Semisupervised Learning

### Supervised Learning
In supervised learning, the training data you feed to the algorithm includes the desired
solutions, called labels.

** Some of the most important supervised learning algorithms are:
1. k-Nearest Neighbors
2. Linear Regression
3. Logistic Regression
4. Support Vector MAchine
5. Decision Trees and Random Forests
6. Neural Networks


### Unsupervised Learning
In unsupervised learning, as you might guess, the training data is unlabeled
(Figure 1-7). The system tries to learn without a teacher.

    ii. Isolation forest
3. Visualization and dimensionality reduction
    i. Principal Component Analysis(PCA)
    ii. Kernel PCA

### Semisupervised Learning

Some algorithms can deal with partially labeled training data, usually a lot of unla‐
beled data and a little bit of labeled data. This is called semisupervised learning.
